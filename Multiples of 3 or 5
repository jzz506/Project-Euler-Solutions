# Project Euler - Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5

## Problem Description
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

**Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.**

## Solution Approach

### Mathematical Derivation (Inclusion-Exclusion Principle)
To find the sum efficiently without iterating, we can use the arithmetic series formula. However, we must apply the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle** to avoid double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15).

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$$

Where:
* $n$ is the number of terms.
* $a_1$ is the first term.
* $a_n$ is the last term.

The total sum is calculated as:
$$\text{Total} = \text{Sum}(3) + \text{Sum}(5) - \text{Sum}(15)$$

## Code Implementation

### 1. Python Solution
This solution is concise and "Pythonic," utilizing a generator expression for memory efficiency.

```python
def solve_problem_1(limit):
    """
    Calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below the given limit.
    """
    return sum(x for x in range(limit) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    LIMIT = 1000
    result = solve_problem_1(LIMIT)
    print(f"The sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below {LIMIT} is: {result}")
